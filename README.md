German Postal Codes

This project concerns itself with German Postal Codes, especially the check if a given code exists or not, and started out as a subtask of GBAN (contrivable/GBAN; German Bank Account Numbers).
Unfortunately sources I found so for want to be paid or obviously do not deliver all postal codes even if they state otherwise.

Goals:
* compile a data set containing all German postal codes
* provide a check for set inclusion of a given postal code
* provide secondary information about postal codes, e.g. date of implementation, classification like communal or business
* ponder if the to-pay-for data set offered by the German Postal Service is worth buying, i.e. likely to be complete; updates?
